#Users don't want rich

For many years now, software developers around the world have been releasing quicker and more capable software on an almost constant basis. Each year, we tend so see new releases of existing products that make the products better in every apparent way, shape and form, and we, the computing public, lap it up. 

For instance, Microsoft Word is currently at it's 11th(-ish) version and still going strong as one of, if not the, most successful word processing packages of all time.  Each year or two Microsoft bring out a new and improved version that adds more features and more capabilities to the average person's arsenal. Now, for a moment, have a think about the last time you used Word.  Assuming you're not one of the 10% of people who "power-use" Word, see if you can name five features of Word that you use on a regular basis. Formatting?  Tables?  Printing?  er..... Word Count? Let's for a moment consider Word, with each and every standard toolbar open:

There's a lot there, and there's a whole load of stuff in there that you've never even seen before. Now, think back to the last time you upgraded your installation of Word.  What was the reasoning behind it?  What was the reason that you (may of) reached into your pocket and forked out for the funky new Office installer? Well, let's take Word 2008 - the headline features there were the Ribbon UI, and support for Office XML formats... and that's about it.  Which of those features made you upgrade? Word probably has more functionality than you need... in fact, waaay more functionality than you'll ever need.  So, why don't you just use WordPad which comes free and is pre-installed on Windows?  Or TextEdit on the Mac? 

Now cast your mind across to the web applications that we, as developers, are creating every day for our clients, be it on a bespoke purely custom basis, or as a product that we roll out to a customer base.  I dare say, that somewhere in your company is a man who works in what some would call 'Marketing'.  This person wants to sell the product out to as many people as possible, and he also wants all of the current user base to upgrade on a regular basis.  Therefore, you most likely have an army of developers creating new features here and there, and making the existing features more capable in every way you can in order to persuade the customer that WhizzBang Enterprises Widget-o-matic 2009 is the best-est thing since last years version (which is now obviously outdated, insecure, and prone to crashing). Why do we, as software shops, do this?  Why do we insist on making our software more complex, and more difficult to use for our customers?

Put yourselves in the shoes of your user (let's call him Bob).  First of all, be aware that Bob is nothing like you.  Bob doesn't use computers for the fun of it, he uses computers to get something else done, so that he can go home on time and get back to work on his new garden terrace.  Bob doesn't really get computers, he doesn't really get the web that much.  Sure he uses Facebook, and emails his chums, and even has his own website (which incidentally is just his twitter stream), but Bob's interested in other things - Bob just wants to get his shit done and go home. 

So, whats the major difference between you and Bob?  Well for starters, for Bob, his computer, and the software on it is a tool - nothing more, nothing less.  He uses his tools to write his documents, send them out to his clients, and ensure that he gets paid at the end of the day.  To Bob his computer is identical to the bag he uses to carry his lunch to work, a tool to achieve a task. So, thinking about tasks - what do most people want?  Well, it's simple really.  

Simplicity.  

People just want to go in, get exactly what they want done with the minimum of fuss, and move on.  Even us developers do it.  We don't sit down in the morning and think "I'm going to sit down for the next eight hours and write some Ruby...", we think "I'm going to sit down for the next eight hours, and get this project finished and out the door".  Our tools are an ends to a means. 

So, coming back to our software, why do we make it so complex? 

Why are we so obsessed with feature richness and whiz bang interactions - the vast majority of people couldn't care less, they just want to get their work done with the minimum of fuss. Let's take a look at richness in applications (the aforementioned whiz-bang element). Recently, there has been a huge movement by Adobe and Microsoft to get developers into using rich platform technologies such as Flash and Silverlight.  Whilst this is all very well, have a quick think about how many applications you use on a day-to-day basis you would consider to be rich (and buzzword bingo favourite "an immersive experience").  

So, what does this say?  Well for me it's a sign that while we developers love to see the demo apps that are coming out and what some people are knocking out, but at the end of the day it's ultimately simplicity and straightforward-ness that we prefer - we just want to get our work done. In essence, I guess we might be guilty of three things - one, overestimating the users motivation and involvement in using the wonderful creation that you've just put out there. Secondly, of overcomplicating what we're making the users use purely for the marketing aspect, rather than making a genuinely good product, and thirdly, for not really eating our own dog food and actually using this rich applications that we keep telling everyone they need. 

Overall, we, as developers, need to keep it focused and keep it simple.  Distractions are aplenty, and we developers are incredibly susceptible to them all which makes us more prone to not keeping it simple...
