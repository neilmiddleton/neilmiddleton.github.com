#Do users get markup?

These days, it doesn’t do to have a website that isn’t attractive, and
easy to read, whilst making stuff easy to find. Yet, increasingly,
websites are not looked after any more by users with any sort of
technical knowledge - they’re all pounding away in the Content
Management system they’ve been given. Thing is, there is a point where
the users creativity will out-do the capabilities of the CMS they have
(or simply FCKEditor, one of the most prolific editors). There’s a few
options you can take here:

1.  Tell them such creativity isn’t possible
2.  Teach them HTML and let them edit manually
3.  Teach them one of the many markup abstractions out there
    ([Markdown][], [Textile][] etc)
4.  Run away

But do users understand markup? For instance, I’ve worked with many
clients in the past who know what they want to achieve, but unless the
tools allow them to do what they want, they get frustrated - they have
no way of moving around the issue. And we’re not talking complex stuff
here, many systems won’t even let you do a simple float, or set a table
column width, without getting into the code. So what are we, as CMS
implementors to do? Do we rely on the user having some basic HTML
skills? Or do we just have systems that restrict the user in what they
want to do. HTML may be simple for web developers, but for normal people
it’s an entirely new language.
