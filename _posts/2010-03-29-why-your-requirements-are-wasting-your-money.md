#Why your requirements are wasting your money

Every single day, I see requirements from clients where they ream off a
list of all the stuff that they would like me to build for them.

Generally speaking these lists are a vision of what the client see’s as
their end product and a dream application that would satisfy their every
need and then some. What every single one of these requirements sets has
in common though, is that they tend to be unnecessarily bloated, and
contain stuff that just isn’t that important. All they do is serve to
push up costs and lengthen and complicate development.

Think about the word “requirement” for a second. There’s a reason for
the word “require” to be in there. Requirements are for the stuff that
has to, without fail, be in the end product. When coming up with
requirements, as you write each one, ask yourself - “Does the product
still function without this requirement being fulfilled?”. 

If the answer is yes, take it out of your requirements and add it to the list of
nice-to-haves that you might have lying around. Not only will this make
your required costs much lower, but it will also serve to reduce
complexity, reduce development time, and ultimately make your end
product better as a result. Chances are it will also push you to drop
some things that you previously thought were required, ultimately saving
you your money and time.
