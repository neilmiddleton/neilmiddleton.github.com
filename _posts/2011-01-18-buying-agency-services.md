#Buying Agency Services
When talking to agencies about getting some work done, always make sure
you’ve talked to the ‘do-er’s’ before you decide who to work on your
project. The sales process is directly similar to a TV ad - it’s
engineered to convince you to buy, and will tell you the good things.
Craftsman on the other hand will tell you things as they are as a sale
isn’t their primary motivation.

If you ever buy services without talking with the guys face to face, or
taking a good look at their previous work and talking about it, you’re
at risk of choosing one of the many cowboys out there that can talk the
talk, but not necessarily walk the walk.
