#You Cannot Afford To Be Left Behind
Things move so fast in technology that the modern day developer simply
cannot afford to not keep up with the day to day changes in trends and
available tooling. Simply ignoring these in place of an ‘old friend’
tool of choice will only serve to leave you behind when your competitors
are striding ahead.

It is critical that the modern day developer does not ignore the new
kids on the block, whatever the reason.
