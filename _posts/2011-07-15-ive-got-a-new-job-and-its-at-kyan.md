#I've got a new job and it's at Kyan
Over the past three years and three months I’ve been working at
[Monochrome][], a digital agency in Epsom, Surrey. However, at the end
of this month I’ll be moving over to [Kyan][], another agency based in
Guildford to join the team doing web development with my weapon of
choice, Ruby on Rails.

Whilst the companies are essentially the same, Kyan represents a new
opportunity and one where I hope I’ll be up to some new and interesting
things with the bunch that work there.

Looking back, Monochrome was a great company to work for, but times move
on, and so must I. However, if you fancy following in my footsteps,
Monochrome [are recruiting][] at the moment. If you’re looking for a
Rails job in Surrey, check it out.
