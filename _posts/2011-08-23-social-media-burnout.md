#Social Media Burnout

This might turn into a long ranty post, so bear with me, it's been in the pipeline for a while.

These days, it appears that you cannot move for another social network popping up. We've got Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Foursquare, Gowalla, LinkedIn, and that's only to name the few that have been reasonably successful, but outside of this very small circle, there's hundreds more.

The problem we have these days is that social isn't a new thing, it's a very well established market online and the main players have already made themselves very well known.  However, every day, there's some other network popping up, and it's normally a clone or vague twist on one of the established players.  Sites like About.me for instance, which fulfill a small niche job, but basically do the same thing as all the other networks out there.

So why?  Well, I would hazard a guess that it's to do with money.  There's a billion and one startups out there who've got the next shit idea that will make them their VC billions - eBay for dentists, Facebook for pets, the list goes on, but the thing is, they're all flawed in so many ways (cats can't type).  But social equals money. We've all seen how much money companies like Facebook and Twitter are allegedly worth* these days, and everyone wants a slice of that pie.

For instance, new network Zerply, a site where you can add your CV online and 'Find like minded people by tags, skills, location and more'.  For starters, other than the fact that it's a bit simpler, and more colourful than LinkedIn - it's LinkedIn, just in a frock.

But what problem does this solve?  It's another place to dump your information and create an online profile / CV.  But would you ever rock up to an interview with a potential employer with your LinkedIn or Zerply profile, or would you spend the time to make a proper resume that you have full control over?

OK, so maybe it's the networking effect that is the key.  Well, again, to this day I've never been introduced to anyone through LinkedIn for work.  I've never got a job through LinkedIn, and I don't know anyone who has.  As far as I am aware, every single person I know has only 'connected' with people they already know, and received a shit load of crap from recruiters.

Ah, yes.  Recruiters.  The underbelly of the IT industry that stalk us at our every turn, and one of the primary reasons I have a LinkedIn account no more.  These buggers keyword search you and send you email for jobs that'll never interest you, and then harass you until you take some action to stop them.  These are the people who like the idea of the online CV, but only because they're generally quite lazy **.

So, let's assume our new social network idea is a good one, where's the next problem?  Well, the fact that everyone is using something else for starters.  Take Google+, the new network from Google.  Functionally it's superior to Facebook in almost every way, and looks nicer to boot, however, even though millions of people have Google accounts it's still relatively quiet.  Why?  Well everyone's using Facebook aren't they...
Your average Joe isn't going to migrate over to Google+ until his buddies do, otherwise he's out there on his own.  It takes a mass migration to get people to change their core network site of choice, and isn't something the web has seen before.  When Facebook popped up there wasn't much else in the way of alternatives.  Whether Facebook maintains it's position for the years to come remains to be seen.

For now though, any social network that is created has an exceptionally massive hill to climb.  Not only has it got to provide something that is relatively feature complete, but it also needs to do something unique (and useful), and woo people away from the tool they know and love already - which is going to be hard.

* If you believe the valuations at all and realise that they aren't just made up money.

** Note, I know plenty of GOOD recruiters, just none in IT.
