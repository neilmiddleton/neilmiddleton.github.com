#What To Do If Your Htc Desire Won't Power On
If you've got an HTC Desire that won't start up (no lights, no nothing) there's a few simple steps that you can do to try and get things back on track.

1. Remove the battery
2. Plug it into the USB cable as if you were charging the phone (leave the back cover off)
3. Replace the battery without plugging in the phone
4. Things should now start working (if not, give the power button a press)

If that doesn't work, try some percussive maintenance and lob it in the bin.
