#Hosting with Heroku

##Introduction

[Heroku][heroku] is a hosting platform based in the United States which I now use as the default choice for hosting all of my Rails and Rack applications wherever possible.

This document is designed to help you get the most from Heroku as a hosting platform.  Due to the particulary good [Heroku documentation][heroku_docs] this is NOT designed to be a starters guide to Heroku, the Heroku documentation does much better than that.  This is designed for people who are already happy using Heroku and understand the basics and want to understand more or learn how to get more from the platform.

This document only deals with the [Celdaon Cedar][cedar] stack, and primarily Rails and Rack, although a lot of it may well apply to the other technologies hosted by Heroku.
